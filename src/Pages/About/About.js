            <p>Goal is very important in life.My goal is web developer.
                My first aim in my life is not to do any such activity which harms the liberty of others.
                I shall never become corrupt and shall never tolerate corruption among others. I shall always be just and fair to others. In every action I will always keep the interest of the community before my personal interest.
